**Description:**
A personal website to showcase my projects and document my learning journey as I explore coding and AI tools.

**AI Usage Note:**
I used GitHub Copilot to help draft my SDLC documents and website content. Copilot provided suggestions for HTML structure, Markdown formatting, and best practices for documentation. It also assisted in generating checklists and design outlines, making the process faster and more organized. Using AI tools allowed me to focus on learning and creativity while ensuring my documentation was clear and complete.
