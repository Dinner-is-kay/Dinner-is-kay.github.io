# Wyatt leopold Intro to AI

## My name is Wyatt Leopold, and this is my portfolio for coding projects! I'm currently studying history and anthropology, however I wanted to learn how coding worked a bit more and how it interacted with AI, so I signed up for this course. I'm still a beginner, but I'm hopeful I can create good things here. Right now, this is just a simple test of a webpage, but there will be more complex projects here later.
