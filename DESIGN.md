# DESIGN

## Page Structure Outline
- Header: Website title and welcome message
- About Section: Brief introduction
- Projects Section: List of projects with descriptions and links
- Footer: Contact or additional notes

## Layout Choices
- Single-page layout for simplicity and ease of navigation
- All content is organized vertically with clear section headings
- No navigation bar, as the content fits comfortably on one page

## Design Rationale
I chose a single-page layout to keep the website simple and beginner-friendly, both for myself as the creator and for visitors. By organizing the content into clear sections (About, Projects), users can quickly find information without clicking through multiple pages. This structure also makes it easier to maintain and update as I add more projects or information in the future. The straightforward design ensures accessibility and a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
